# Must run BEFORE entrypoint.sh, because fluxbox reads ~/.fluxbox/apps once at
# startup and will not overwrite a file that is already there.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# fluxbox 1.3.7 leaves session.screen0.windowPlacement unset, so it falls back to
# RowSmartPlacement: each new window is positioned to avoid overlapping the
# windows already on screen.  That makes position a function of whatever else
# happens to be open, which is exactly what you do not want in a recording.
#
# It compounds, because a dialog is centred on its parent:
#
#   main window        placed by the app, then resized by position-window.sh
#   compose window     placed by RowSmartPlacement, relative to the main window
#   SMTP password box  centred on the compose window
#
# So the outgoing-server password prompt inherits two layers of variability, and a
# macro that clicks its OK button at fixed coordinates misses.  That is what broke
# the last three steps of the Thunderbird recording.
#
# Fixing it here rather than in the macro matters: window management done with
# xdotool is NOT an input event, so xmacrorec2 does not record it and replay would
# never repeat it.  The window manager, on the other hand, applies these rules
# identically at record time and at replay time - both runs go through the same
# setup-commands in the same image.
set -euo pipefail

# The main window's res_name - the FIRST field of WM_CLASS, e.g. "Mail" for
# Thunderbird's 3-pane.  Optional: without it every window including the main one
# is merely centred, which is still fully reproducible, just not fullscreen.
#
# To find it for a client, run it and read the property off the window:
#   apt-get install -y x11-utils      # xprop is not in the image
#   DISPLAY=:99 xprop -id "$(xdotool search --onlyvisible --name '<title>' | head -1)" WM_CLASS
# Thunderbird's 3-pane reports "Mail", "thunderbird-esr"; its compose window
# reports "Msgcompose" and its dialogs "Thunderbird", all sharing the res_class.
MAIN_NAME="${1:-}"
WIDTH="${2:-1440}"
HEIGHT="${3:-900}"
# Optional res_class, for clients where the res_name alone is ambiguous.
# BlueMail needs it: it maps a 20x20 tray window that shares the res_name
# "bluemail" with the main window and differs only in res_class ("Bluemail"
# against the main window's "BlueMail").  Without the extra term the tray window
# matches too and fluxbox blows it up to a full-screen, undecorated 1440x900 that
# covers the mailbox.
MAIN_CLASS="${4:-}"
# Optional WM_WINDOW_ROLE, for clients whose dialogs are indistinguishable from
# the main window by WM_CLASS alone - which is most of them.
#
# Claws Mail needs it.  Its password prompt, its progress windows and its
# compose window all report WM_CLASS "claws-mail", "Claws-mail", so without a
# role the main-window rule below matches them too and moves them to 0,0 - where
# fluxbox stacks them UNDER the full-screen main window.  The prompt is then
# invisible and modal: the folder tree stops responding to clicks and the client
# looks like it has hung.  Only the main window carries
# WM_WINDOW_ROLE = "mainwindow", so naming it confines the rule to that window
# and every dialog falls through to the centring rule instead.
#
# Read it off a running client with:
#   DISPLAY=:99 xprop -id "$(xdotool search --onlyvisible --name '<title>' | head -1)" \
#       WM_CLASS WM_WINDOW_ROLE
MAIN_ROLE="${5:-}"

# ONLY (name=...) IS RELIABLE IN THIS IMAGE. Measured against LibreOffice Writer
# 24.2.7, whose document window reports WM_CLASS "libreoffice",
# "libreoffice-writer" and no WM_WINDOW_ROLE:
#
#   (name=libreoffice)          pinned    0,0 1440x900, decorations gone
#   (class=libreoffice-writer)  no match  0,44 1440x875
#   (class=libreoffice)         no match  0,44 1440x875
#   (name=libreoffice-writer)   no match  0,44 1440x875
#   (title=.*Writer)            no match  0,44 1440x875
#
# fluxbox evaluates an [app] rule when the window is MAPPED, and at that moment
# LibreOffice has set its res_name but not yet its final res_class or title -
# both of which it fills in once it knows which module owns the document. So a
# rule written against the properties you read off a settled window matches
# nothing, silently, and the window is simply left where the app put it.
#
# Read the properties, then confirm the rule actually fires by checking the
# geometry. A rule that does not match is invisible: no error, no warning, just
# an unpinned window and reference screenshots taken at the wrong size.
#
# Dialogs that share the main window's res_name are not a problem here even
# though the rule matches them too: fluxbox centres a window with
# WM_TRANSIENT_FOR on its parent regardless of [Position], and Writer's dialogs
# additionally carry a program-specified maximum size, so [Dimensions] is
# clamped. Find and Replace stays 574x403 centred with the full-screen rule
# active. An app whose dialogs are NOT transient and carry no maximum size would
# need a discriminator - and would need one that works at map time.

# --- keys: no keyboard grabs at all ---------------------------------------
#
# fluxbox's default keys file binds Control+F1..F12 to "switch to workspace N".
# It grabs those combinations at the X server, so the application never sees
# them - and Ctrl+F12 is Insert Table in LibreOffice Writer.
#
# The failure is silent and looks like a crash. Ctrl+F12 sent to Writer moves
# the display to workspace 12, which is empty: `xdotool search` returns nothing,
# `import -window root` comes back fully transparent, and the soffice processes
# are still running. Nothing in any log mentions it. Ctrl+F1 brings it back.
#
# It would happen identically on replay, so it cannot be worked around in the
# driver - the keystroke has to reach the application.
#
# The default file also grabs Mod1+F1/F2/F4/F5/F9/F10/F11 and Mod1+space. Rather
# than strip the twelve dangerous lines and leave the rest to be discovered one
# application at a time, this writes a keys file with NO keyboard bindings
# whatsoever. Mouse bindings are kept so fluxbox still behaves like a window
# manager. Nothing in a recording uses a window-manager keybinding: the whole
# point is that every keystroke belongs to the application under test.
#
# fluxbox will not overwrite an existing keys file, and this runs before
# fluxbox starts, so this is the file it reads.

# The toolbar is hidden for two reasons.  It reserves a 45 px strut at the bottom
# of the screen, and fluxbox clamps a full-height window to the area left over -
# so a window asked for 1440x900 silently becomes 1440x855, every y coordinate
# below the fold shifts, and clicks aimed at the bottom of the window miss.  It
# also carries a live clock, which is a moving pixel in any full-screen capture.
