# This is the equivalent of the template's "Check HTTP Status Code" step, moved
# to the FRONT of the flow. Playwright can report a status code from the same
# navigation it measured; a real browser cannot, so the status has to be taken
# separately - and once it is separate, taking it first is strictly better. A
# typo in __GMT_VAR_PAGE__ then costs a couple of seconds instead of a warmup, a
# browser start and two measured phases of a browser rendering an error page.
#
# The certificate check is the other half, and it is the more valuable one.
# --cacert without --insecure means curl builds a chain from squid's freshly
# minted leaf to the CA committed in this repository. If squid is rebuilt with a
# new signing certificate, this line fails with a certificate error naming the
# problem, instead of two browsers silently showing an interstitial in a phase
# that still produces a plausible-looking energy figure.
