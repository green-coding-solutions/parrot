#
# WHY THE CERTIFICATE WORK IS NEEDED
#
# greencoding/squid_reverse_proxy is a MITM cache: it terminates TLS, signs a
# certificate for the site on the fly, and serves the response from its own
# store. The GMT playwright templates get away with ignoring that, because
# Playwright is launched with ignoreHTTPSErrors. A real browser has no such
# switch that is safe to use - Firefox has no "ignore all certificate errors"
# pref at all - so the proxy's signing certificate has to be a trust anchor in
# the browser's own NSS database. That is what certutil does below.
#
# The certificate in websites/squid-ca.crt is an INTERMEDIATE ("Enterprise
# Subordinate CA"), not a self-signed root, and squid sends only the leaf plus
# this one. NSS is happy to anchor a chain at a non-self-signed certificate that
# is marked trusted, which is why the trust flags matter and why the check at
# the end of this script exists: a certificate that is present but not trusted
# fails exactly like one that was never imported, and it fails as a blank error
# page halfway through a measured phase rather than here.
